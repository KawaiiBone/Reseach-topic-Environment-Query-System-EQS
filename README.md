 ## What is it
 
It is a feature for an ai, to obtain information from its environment. Then collect that information to see via a couple of tests. Which of the information that is collected, is the most needed at the moment in time.  

A good example is to know where you have seen food and then if needed, go to the nearest place where you can obtain that.
